The other day I wrote about how USDT has become somewhat [untethered]({% link _posts/2017-04-22-untethered.md %}) from the US dollar and how you could technically take advantage of this market inefficiency to make a 7% profit.

On paper this seems like a good idea. But is it really?

- Volatility


- Risk Adjusted volatility
- CAPM

Why fight the market when you can delegate to it?

After all, an $1000 investment in Ethereum in Jan 2016 would be worth ~$49k in April 2017.

That's one hell of a return.

Doing the investment this way isn't as sexy but it has a couple of advantages. First of all, losses were capped at 100% whereas the return would have been 4800%. Second, the other $19k that was going to be put through arbitrage could now be allocated $1k each in 19 other altcoins. This decreases the chance at a total loss while increasing the likely hood that you will have a winner.

Let's see how the options stack up:
- Risk 100% to gain 7% by converting USD to USDT and holding --could work but it it doesn't you are screwed
- Risk 100% to gain 4800% by finding the next Ethereum

Seems obvious that the focus should be to find the next Ethereum.
