title: Use FancyHands to setup supermarket cards
---

A few years ago, I started using an affordable virtual assistant service called [FancyHands](http://fhands.com/X0PzeM8) and absolutely fell in love. 

At the time the quality was phenomenal. I had FancyHands compile reports, book meetings, make calls, etc.

This is because you could send extremely complex requests and come through nearly every time.

Over time, however, this must not have been scaleable because the quality dropped. The assistants started messing things up or sending back poor quality answers.

If you are like me there are dozens of simple things on your todo list that need to get done. So I didn't cancel. Having access to an on demand admin workforce is extremely powerful. The problem is that there is a lot of cognative load associated with figuring out what and how to send things to FancyHands --or similar services.

So far I've sent over 1000 requests to FancyHands and saved 4 days of total time. Through this experience I've gone through the painstaking effort of figuring out what works and what doesn't.

I've decided to share what I've learned.

Under the tag "vascripts" I'm going to share with you some of these 1000 requests so that you too can save some of this time. These are "scripts" much like computer scripts, meaning that you can just copy, paste, and send. Tweak them if needed, send them to your friends.

Here is the first one and it's designed to save you the pain of carrying around those little supermarket membership cards.

Enjoy!
