Why fight the market when you can delegate to it?

A $1000 investment in Ethereum in Jan 2016 would be worth ~$49k in April 2017.

That's one hell of a return.

Doing the investment this way isn't as sexy but it has a couple of advantages. First of all, losses were capped at 100% whereas the return would have been 4800%. Second, the other $19k that was going to be put through arbitrage could now be allocated $1k each in 19 other altcoins. This decreases the chance at a total loss while increasing the likely hood that you will have a winner.

Let's see how the options stack up:
- Risk 100% to gain 6% doing a multi-platform arbitrage --I've done this before and sweat bullets the whole time
- Risk 100% to gain 7% by converting USD to USDT and holding --could work but it it doesn't you are screwed
- Risk 100% to gain 4800% by finding the next Ethereum

Seems obvious that the focus should be to find the next Ethereum.
