A few weeks ago, I had an interesting conversation about self-driving cars with a Lyft driver who grew up in a high-crime neighborhood of Los Angeles.

> “Self-driving cars won’t work where I grew up” he said, “since the car is programmed not to hit people, criminals will stand in the middle of the street to stop a car, then pull a gun and rob the passengers.”

When I heard this I immediately had two thoughts:
1. I know less than I think I know
2. Would a world where automaiton is prevelant, 

[I've covered not knowing before](https://itscoffeeti.me/i-like-to-think-that-i-m-intelligent-but-how-do-i-really-know-b3e353957274) so lets explore 

You could argue that crime is primarily motivated by scarcity and that humanity is destined for a Star Trekesque post scarcity utopia.

This argument would sound something like: "The have-nots take from the haves because ultimately the haves can afford it, in the future machines will make everything affordable". 

"Affording" really boils down to having something to trade for the work that is required to produce and distribute the thing that needs to be "afforded". 

Throughout much of human history, creating something required physical work by humans. So being able to afford a set of shoes meant that you needed to be able to trade the local cobbler for them. Recently (the last 150 years) we have created machines that help with this physical work. So our local cobbler became Nike/Adidas/Ivanka Trump, who used machines and people to reduce the cost of shoes to the point that the average woman now owns 20 shoes at any given time.

Currently, the 'haves' can access to the low-cost labor that produces the labor relative to the 'haves' income. 

In the case of many "haves" they were born into situations where they have family wealth to trade, or they were able to acquire valuable skills that they could bring to the marketplace to trade. Those who have nothing to trade are left to beg, borrow, or steal --often times all three.

But what happens when



and things like automation will distribute this labor access to the have-nots as well.

The counterargument to this would be that globalization has made it dificult for



This world is the digital world. It has its own economy, its own cele


So the argument would be that in a world where labor is cheap because its automated, the cost of goods goes down so you wouldnt need to live a similar lifestyle as a “have” today. And “haves” dont commit crime right?

Wrong.

Here are examples of situations where scarcity isnt the primary driver of crime:

- Madoff
