Email is such a wonderful medium for communicating with people but if you're like me it can be a bit of an issue.

Sometimes I'll draft an email that I think looks great. Before I send I read it, re-read it, and even read it out loud only the come back later and find that the email is missing words or had things misspelled.

Usually, for something important, I have my wife read it back to me out loud. But sometimes she isn't around so I use the computer.

Heres how you can use this hack if you are using macOS and Chrome.

In Chrome, highlight all the text you want the computer to read back to you, right click, go to the "speech" section and click "start speaking". At this point the computer will read out loud exactly what you've written. This also works for blog posts or articles that you want the computer to read while you are doing something else.

### Using macOS to read you anything

For bonus points, if you want the computer to read something that is not in the browser, you can use macOS's built in TextEdit application. To find TextEdit go to the "Applications" folder and click on the TextEdit application.

Next just paste in the text you want the computer to read, then select the text, right click, and look for the same "speech" menu as in Chrome.

So there you have it, a quick little hack to hear what you've written. Hope it helps!
