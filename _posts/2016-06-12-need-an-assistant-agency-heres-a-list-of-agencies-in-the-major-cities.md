You probably found yourself here because you are looking for an assistant and you realize that good assistants are hard to come by.

One of the first things that you should consider when it comes to hiring an assistant is if you even need a "full assistant" in the first place. In the early days of running [Vesper](http://www.vesper.ai), I was surprised to find out that 75% of the tasks that most people had their assistants working on were personal logistics like scheduling and travel arrangements.

**For these people hiring a full assistant would be like buying a cable package just so that they could watch a few channels.**

On the other hand, services like [Wonder](http://askwonder.com) for research, and Vesper for [scheduling or travel arrangements](https://www.vesper.ai) allow for you to "piece together" an assistant for a fraction of the cost.

This would be like just buying the two channels that you want to watch instead of buying a whole cable package.

I do, however, still recognize that sometimes you need a full blown assistant. If this is the case for you, here is a list of some assistant staffing agencies in the major cities that you can use to help you find someone.
