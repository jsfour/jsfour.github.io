title: A case against no code solutions
excerpt: This is the problem with "no code". It assumes that "coding" is the hard part of the process but really thinking through a problem is what needs specialized training and experience.

The other day a friend asked me if I had spent time playing around with [Coda.io](https://coda.io)

I responded: **“No because I can build whatever I need to. Not sure I agree with the thesis. It’s probably something that works in the tech industry but will struggle outside of it.”**

My friend, who is non technical, makes a mistake that most non technical people make: He believes that being able to “code” is the barrier to building digital products.

But it’s not. The barrier is a way of thinking.

The best “coders” I’ve worked with only spend 20% of their time actually "coding". The other 80% of the time is spent thinking about the problem they are trying to solve and exploring different ways of solving it by reading, white boarding, talking with other developers, etc. Once they have a good understanding of the problem and a good idea of a solution then writing the actual code is usually easy. 

This is, by the way, the things that separates senior developers from junior developers. Seniors have seen/solved a wide array of problems. This means that senior devs can accelerate the thinking step by using what they have done in the past. Sometimes this means reusing old code but that doesn't matter because **“coding” is just syntax**. Meaning it’s just a specific way of writing the instructions that the developer has come up with while thinking. 

So the "code" portion of something doesn't matter all that much. What matters is getting to the point where you can make a set of instructions to solve the problem.

This is the problem with "no code". It assumes that "coding" is the hard part of the process but really thinking through a problem is what needs specialized training and experience.

So until we start training people how to think like engineers, I doubt "no code" tools will have broad main market adoption.
