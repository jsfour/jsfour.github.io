As a continuation of my Blockchain series, on this episode I sit down to chat with Fred Krueger.

Fred is a Stanford PhD and serial entrepreneur with 9 significant exits. He is focused on making consumer blockchain and high volume daaps a reality. EOS Lynx is the fastest growing wallet on the EOS Blockchain, and Workcoin is a gig marketplace on EOS that will launch in October.

We talk broadly about Blockchain usability but the highlight of the conversation is Fred's thoughts about the roll that stablecoins will play in the future of crypto.
