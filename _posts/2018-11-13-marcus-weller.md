This episode is a continuation of my Blockchain series where I sit down with people working in the cryptocurrency/blockchain space to try to find out how the blockchain will impact the world.

In this episode, I sit down with Dr Marcus Weller. 

Marcus has been a Founder, CEO, and Advisor to companies spanning consumer electronics, blockchain, and biotechnology since 2012. Starting in 2009, Dr. Weller served as 1 of 10 Americans selected by the Humboldt Foundation to develop scientific ties in the field of Psychology between Germany and the United States. 

While in Germany, Dr. Weller also studied Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Munich. After graduating from Wayne State University with a PhD in Industrial Psychology with a subfocus in Data Science, Dr. Weller joined Maxim Semiconductor in Silicon Valley before founding one of the first consumer Augmented Reality technology companies in 2012. Dr. Weller is an inventor on over 20 patent applications spanning areas including biotechnology, consumer electronics, and pharmacodynamics, and has been fortunate enough to learn alongside some of the best innovators in the world. 

Marcus is currently CMO at iTrust Capital and Head of Science at Halcyon Biotechnologies Inc. 

We talk about what consolidation may look like in crypto, tribalism in the space, and we ask one big question: Can the world truly be decentralized?
