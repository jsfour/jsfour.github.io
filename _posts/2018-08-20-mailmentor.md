A few years ago, along with some colleagues, I setout to develop a "sales coach in a box" called Mailmentor. The goal was to help salespeople write better sales emails. The project was a lot of fun, however, we pivoted away from maintaining it.

Keeping the servers running, however, was costing me about $50 a month and given the traffic levels, I've opted to shut the servers down. Mailmentor.io now directs to this blog post.

I've thought about open sourcing the source code. If this is of interest to you [subscribe]({% link newsletter.md %}) to receive notifications of updates in the future.

Thanks for all of the support.
