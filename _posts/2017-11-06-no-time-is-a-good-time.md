This morning was in the bathroom taking care of business when I heard the door knob start to turn.

"Damn I forgot to lock the door" I thought as my 18 month old daughter walked into the bathroom. In her hands was a kids a book named "If I were a dog".

"Your timing is priceless Brynn" I said. The look on her face indicated that she understood but had absolutely zero fucks to give. She obviously wanted the book read.

In that moment that I learned another one of the numerous lessons Brynn has taught me: there isn't a perfect time for anything.

And you know what, she is right.
