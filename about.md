# About Me
Hi my name is Jimi. I fell in love with building software when I was 14 years old and am fortunate that I am able to do the thing that I love every day.

In 2011, I built what is now known as the [Bishop Video Platform](http://www.pk4media.com) while working full time as an Innovation Manager in the advertising industry. Although Bishop started as a side project, it generated seven figures in revenue its first year and was acquired by PK4 Media in 2012. After the acquisition I joined [PK4 Media](http://www.pk4media.com) and served as Vice President of Product & Technology for two years. During my tenure I rebuilt the engineering team and most of the company's technology infrastructure before leaving to start another company.

More recently, I founded the product studio [Octavius Labs](https://www.octaviuslabs.com) to help companies grow by rethinking their product and technology strategy.

In my spare time these days I like to pilot airplanes, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30750463-jimi-smoot?utf8=%E2%9C%93&utf8=%E2%9C%93&shelf=read&per_page=infinite), and hang around Los Angeles with my wife, kids, and doggie son [Alejandro](http://www.instagram.com/jefecubano).

Little known fact: During my time studying Marketing and Communications at the University of Nevada Las Vegas I worked as an Audio Engineer and Disc Jockey to pay the bills. I also somehow convinced the music school to give me a scholarship for Jazz Trombone and Marching Band.
